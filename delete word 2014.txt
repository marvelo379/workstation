Write a program to accept a sentence which may be terminated by either ‘.’ ‘?’ or ‘!’ only. Any other character may be ignored. The words may be separated by more than one blank space and are in UPPER CASE.
Perform the following tasks:
(a)        Accept the sentence and reduce all the extra blank space between two words to
a single blank space.
(b)        Accept a word from the user which is part of the sentence along with its
position number and delete the word and display the sentence.
